# infoApp
An Android App that provides information about specific event. 

Single-activity app, with hooked intents to handle user interaction.

It's some kind of interactive business card. 

The application has the ability to make a phone call to a defined number (after confirmation by the user), open the organization page, send an email to a predefined address, and create an event in the calendar (in progress, it not finished yet)

In the future, I would like to add the ability to remotely update the presented data (maybe using Firebase, we will see;))

In case of creation of APK file, and installation outside of Android Studio, the app requires permission to making calls, create and modify calendar events.
